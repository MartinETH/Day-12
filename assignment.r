# most frequent between 26 and 35, considering only subsequences with at least two events.

# e.g., since sequence start is at 20 years old, to specify age 29, you should give 9 (= 29 ô€€€ 20.)

## Hardly any "lift" visible (not much increased likelihood of experiencing one of these states after starting sequence with "P")
## Contentwise, these links do not seem very surprising (apart from the fact that some people seem to be staying at home despite having married (and even becoming a parent))

# 4. Define a vector of event weights inversely proportional to the event frequencies

# 5. Using the previously computed event weights together with a time shift cost equal
# to 0.1, compute the matrix of normalized OME dissimilarities.

# 6. Compute the four-cluster solution using the weighted PAM method and label the
# clusters with their respective medoid sequence. 
# (Tips: Retrieve the medoids with function disscenter together with argument medoids.index="first".)

#### I was able to build my own code following the sample solution, but I could not produce lines 107/108 myself.

# 7. Render the clusters using (a) the parallel coordinate plot, and (b) the survival
# probability curves until first occurrence of each event except `P'.
